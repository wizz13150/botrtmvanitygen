Hey!

I'm RTMVanityGen Bot that can generate vanity addresses for Raptoreum (RTM).
Here are the commands you can use:

    /vanity [pattern1] [pattern2]
    
This command allows you to add a new vanity address pattern, or several, to the queue.
- Each pattern must be between 2 chars and 8 chars max, and must start with "R".
- The second character must not be one of the following: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, Z.
- Each pattern can only contain the following characters:
'123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

    /vtest [pattern]
    
This command allows you to test the difficulty of a vanity address pattern and see the expected time to process.


    /vqueue
    
This command shows you the current state of the vanity address queue.


    /vcancel [number]
    
This command allows you to remove the last request, or several, from the queue.


    /vcurrent
    
This command shows you the current vanity address pattern that is being searched.


    /vme
    
This command shows you the vanity address patterns that you have added to the queue.


    /vhistory [number]
    
This command shows you the last request from others. Default is 25, Max is 100.


    /vhelp
    
Inception. Abort.


The Magic Number is a random number between 0 and 9999 generated every /vanity command.
